## How to Use the Tests

### Test File Naming Convention

- Each test file is named descriptively to indicate the specific scenario being tested.
- Files are plain text (.txt) for easy readability.

### Running Tests

1. Navigate to the specific project folder you want to test.
2. Review the test case files to understand the different scenarios.
3. Use these test files as a reference or input for your project implementations.

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests

1. Create a folder for a new project if it doesn't exist.
2. Add test case files with clear and descriptive names.
3. Ensure test cases cover various scenarios and edge cases.

## Notes

- Test files are meant to be used as guidance and reference.
- Always verify and validate tests against the specific project requirements.
